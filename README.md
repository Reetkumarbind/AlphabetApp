## 🌈 Gradient UI: Seamless, Edge-to-Edge Design

Your **AlphabetApp** now includes a professionally crafted **multi-layered gradient background** that elevates the visual experience to the next level.

### ✅ Implementation Summary:

- **📌 Root-Level Gradient (MainActivity)**  
  Set a vertical gradient behind the `Scaffold` using `Modifier.background()` in the root-level Composable.

- **🪄 Transparent Scaffold**  
  Configured with `containerColor = Color.Transparent` to allow the gradient to shine through every component.

- **🌐 Edge-to-Edge UI**  
  Leveraged `enableEdgeToEdge()` to extend visuals to the status bar and bottom navigation areas.

### 🎨 Gradient Color Stops:

```kotlin
val gradientColors = listOf(
    Color(0xFF667eea), // Soft blue-purple (top)
    Color(0xFF764ba2), // Rich purple (middle)
    Color(0xFFf093fb)  // Vibrant pink (bottom)
)
```
